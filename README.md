## 🚌 Bus Reservation System (C++ Project)

A console-based Bus Reservation System built using C++.
This project demonstrates the use of OOP concepts (Classes & Objects), Functions, Arrays, and File Handling.
It provides a simple way to manage buses, book seats, and view passenger details — all inside your terminal.
